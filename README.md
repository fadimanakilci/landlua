> **Dynamically customize your Flutter app's UI and behavior with Lua scripting,
> eliminating the need for frequent updates on app stores!** 🚀

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to **Lua-Enhanced Flutter App** — a revolutionary approach to managing your Flutter
application's user interface, data, and behavior remotely. By integrating Lua scripting, 
this project allows you to dynamically alter app components on the fly, freeing you from the 
constraints of constant updates and app store approval processes.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic UI Updates**: Modify UI components without needing to push updates to app stores.
- **Lua Scripting**: Easily integrate Lua scripts to control app behavior remotely.
- **Remote Configuration**: Fetch and execute Lua scripts directly from your server.
- **Flexible & Scalable**: Perfect for apps that require frequent changes in design, content, or features.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Fetch Lua Scripts**: The app fetches Lua scripts from a remote server.
2. **Execute Scripts**: Lua scripts are executed within the app, allowing real-time updates.
3. **Output Integration**: Lua's `print` function outputs directly to Flutter’s console for debugging and monitoring.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the app up and running:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fadimanakilci/landlua.git
    cd repo
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

4. **Enjoy the power of Lua scripting in your Flutter app!**

## 🔧 Configuration

To modify the Lua script fetching behavior, update the `getLuaScriptFromServer()` function within your code:

```dart
String getLuaScriptFromServer() {
  return r'''
    -- Sample Lua script
    print("Hello, Lua is now controlling this app!")
  ''';
}
```

## 📄 Sample Output

Example output directly from Lua running in your app:

```plaintext
[LUA] a value is 10
[LUA] a value is 11
...
[LUA] a value is 19
```
